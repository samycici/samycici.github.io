### [Qualidade - Definindo uma estratégia para Mobile Apps](https://speakerdeck.com/samycici/qualidade-definindo-uma-estrategia-para-mobile-apps) 
November, 2018

Have you ever wondered what software quality really means in your current project? Have you thought about what strategy you should address to achieve user satisfaction? Of course "working" functionality is very important, but what's more? Let's talk about setting a quality strategy for apps.

### [O que é qualidade de software (na real) e como ela influencia na cultura DevOps](https://speakerdeck.com/samycici/o-que-e-qualidade-de-software-na-real-e-como-ela-influencia-na-cultura-devops) 
October, 2018

"What is software quality" is a question that can be answered in several ways. Some people will cite automated testing, others will talk about software without bugs, or frequent deliveries. But have you ever stopped to think about what software quality really means in your current project? Have you thought about what strategy you should address to achieve user satisfaction? Of course "working" functionality is very important, but what's more? What other features are important? Accessibility, compatibility, scale? Let's talk about quality view as a set of components that adds value to the end user and how it influences the DevOps culture.

### [INTERCON - Automatizando Visual Regression Testing](https://www.slideshare.net/samantacicilia/intercon-automatizando-visual-regression-testing) 
October, 2018

In my last project I had the challenge of automating tests for graphics where colors, shapes and details were very important to functionality. The solution was to apply Visual Regression Testing and ensure that these visual aspects were as expected. In this talk we will see what is Visual Regression Testing and examples of how to automate using some market tools (Percy, Lineup, Visual Review, AppliTools) and also that you can implement your own.

### [TOT Meetup | Especificação Por Exemplo](https://goo.gl/wGXdst) 
August, 2018

Many people believe that Specification By Example is just a testing tool, but in reality it is a very powerful tool that adds standards ranging from product design to continuous software delivery to build a quality product. In this meetup we will know the theory of Specification For Example from the perspective of some authors (Martin Fowler, Gojko Adzic, Craig Larman), the benefits of its use, some techniques and tools that can be used during the cycle and then put into practice through group discussions.

### [DevOps Summit Brasil - O que não te contaram sobre Agile Testing](https://www.slideshare.net/samantacicilia/devops-summit-brasil-o-que-no-te-contaram-sobre-agile-testing)
April, 2017

The community has been talking about Agile Testing for some time now. Terms such as Automated Testing and Continuous Integration are already in the blood of the teams, but is that enough? Agile Testing is much more than just automating testing: it's addressing the challenges and proposing solutions that add value to the product. In this talk we will talk about some challenges: - Strategies for data setup in automation projects - How to distribute (in practice) the tests inside the Test Automation Pyramid - Challenges that we have already faced (for example: how to automate an application login that needs of a token that arrives by SMS?) - How to think outside the box and add value to the product using the test mindset

April, 2017

Specification for example is a set of patterns that help build the right product the right way. Many people attribute their use to only the test portion of software, but it goes far beyond that and has valuable tips on how much collaboration can help us discover what our customers really need.

### [Importância de Testes Automatizados para Continuous Delivery & DevOps](https://www.slideshare.net/samantacicilia/cnqs-testes-automatizados-continuous-delivery)
July, 2016

The market has demanded more and more rapid delivery of development teams to meet business demands and maintain competitiveness. To ensure that these deliveries happen in the expected and quality time, it is very important to invest in all levels of automated testing. Let's see what these test levels are and some practical examples using Python for unit testing, integration, functional, performance, and mutation.
