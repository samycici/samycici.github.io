In the previous week I attended to San Francisco Test Bash, an event organized by Ministry Of Testing.
For those who don't know, Ministry is the largest test community in the world, it was founded by Rosie Sherry, and has Meetups in several countries (here, in Brazil, we have the RJ and Recife meetups), The Club, Dojo and the Test Bash which are conferences with speakers from around the world.
